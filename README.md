# Files-Exceptions-and-Errors-in-Python

This repository consists of codes for 2 tasks

## Task 1: read a file and handle errors

A simple Python script that:

- Tries to open and read all lines from sample.txt
- Checks if the file is empty and prints a message if so
- Displays each line with its corresponding line number
- Handles the error if the file does not exist and shows a proper message

File: `task1_read_handle_errors.py`

## Task 2: Write, Append, and Read from a File with User Input

A simple Python script that:

- Takes user input and writes it to a file called output.txt (overwrites if it exists)
- Takes another user input and appends it on a new line
- Reads and displays the final content of the file
- Ensures each user input appears on a separate line

File: `task2_append_data.py`
